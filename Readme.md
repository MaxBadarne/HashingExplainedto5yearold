HashingExplainedto5yearold

When someone who isnt tech friendly asked me about google knowing all of our passwords because 
"they store them they have access to them" and that "any worker can just go in and see the passwords "
I created a very simple hashing algorithm to demonstrate how that wasnt the case, and how it can be stored in the database without anyone knowing it.

```
main.py
